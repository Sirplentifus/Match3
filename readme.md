A minimalistic game using SDL 2.0

This is a game I made following online tutorials just for fun.

The tutorials that I followed, and even copied code from, are:
	*[Lazy foo](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/)
	*[SDL Tutorials](http://www.sdltutorials.com/)
	
I also used the library provided by
	*[ferzkopp.net](http://www.ferzkopp.net/wordpress/2016/01/02/sdl_gfx-sdl2_gfx/), which I copy pasted into my code (maybe with some modifications)
